# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up repo and read through some blog posts.

**Thoughts:** I'd like to be able to make some projects I'm proud of, but I struggle with "it's been done before"

**Link to work:** [My Profile - you're probably aready here](github.com/wmpedersen)
